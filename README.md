## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI project showcasing various sample visualizations using three distinct datasets from [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/). These datasets were chosen for their rich data content, making them ideal for training and practicing creating insightful and interactive visualizations using Power BI.

## Datasets

1. [**Australian Fatal Car Accident Data**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/australian-fatal-car-accident-data-19892021): information about fatal car accidents in Australia, including location, causes, and vehicle types involved.

## Pages and Visualizations

The Power BI project is organized into separate pages, each dedicated to one of the datasets. Each page includes a variety of visualizations to present key insights and trends:

- Shape Map
- Filters
- Column Chart
- Table
- Card
- Area Chart
- Treemap
- Line and Stacked Column Chart
- Radar Chart

The project also utilizes concepts like tooltips:
